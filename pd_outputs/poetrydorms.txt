1 Comrades, leave me here a little, while as yet 't is early morn: DORM: 2.43, DORM-UIDO:1.38,
2 Leave me here, and when you want me, sound upon the bugle-horn. DORM: 6.75, DORM-UIDO:0.08,
3 'T is the place, and all around it, as of old, the curlews call, DORM: 3.32, DORM-UIDO:1.70,
4 Dreary gleams about the moorland flying over Locksley Hall; DORM: 4.40, DORM-UIDO:3.08,
5 Locksley Hall, that in the distance overlooks the sandy tracts, DORM: 4.67, DORM-UIDO:3.24,
6 And the hollow ocean-ridges roaring into cataracts. DORM: 13.45, DORM-UIDO:6.29,
7 Many a night from yonder ivied casement, ere I went to rest, DORM: 11.83, DORM-UIDO:5.92,
8 Did I look on great Orion sloping slowly to the West. DORM: 4.32, DORM-UIDO:3.20,
9 Many a night I saw the Pleiads, rising thro' the mellow shade, DORM: 9.69, DORM-UIDO:3.91,
10 Glitter like a swarm of fire-flies tangled in a silver braid. DORM: 3.91, DORM-UIDO:2.59,
11 Here about the beach I wander'd, nourishing a youth sublime DORM: 11.26, DORM-UIDO:4.71,
12 With the fairy tales of science, and the long result of Time; DORM: 3.05, DORM-UIDO:2.01,
13 When the centuries behind me like a fruitful land reposed; DORM: 3.72, DORM-UIDO:2.23,
14 When I clung to all the present for the promise that it closed: DORM: 2.40, DORM-UIDO:0.97,
15 When I dipt into the future far as human eye could see; DORM: 3.16, DORM-UIDO:1.39,
16 Saw the Vision of the world and all the wonder that would be.— DORM: 1.50, DORM-UIDO:0.70,
17 In the Spring a fuller crimson comes upon the robin's breast; DORM: 3.95, DORM-UIDO:2.75,
18 In the Spring the wanton lapwing gets himself another crest; DORM: 4.85, DORM-UIDO:3.48,
19 In the Spring a livelier iris changes on the burnish'd dove; DORM: 10.76, DORM-UIDO:4.57,
20 In the Spring a young man's fancy lightly turns to thoughts of love. DORM: 3.62, DORM-UIDO:2.64,
21 Then her cheek was pale and thinner than should be for one so young, DORM: 2.03, DORM-UIDO:0.74,
22 And her eyes on all my motions with a mute observance hung. DORM: 3.83, DORM-UIDO:2.45,
23 And I said, "My cousin Amy, speak, and speak the truth to me, DORM: 2.79, DORM-UIDO:2.03,
24 Trust me, cousin, all the current of my being sets to thee." DORM: 1.93, DORM-UIDO:1.27,
25 On her pallid cheek and forehead came a colour and a light, DORM: 3.77, DORM-UIDO:2.56,
26 As I have seen the rosy red flushing in the northern night. DORM: 3.40, DORM-UIDO:2.27,
27 And she turn'd—her bosom shaken with a sudden storm of sighs— DORM: 10.87, DORM-UIDO:4.77,
28 All the spirit deeply dawning in the dark of hazel eyes— DORM: 3.94, DORM-UIDO:2.81,
29 Saying, "I have hid my feelings, fearing they should do me wrong"; DORM: 2.47, DORM-UIDO:1.30,
30 Saying, "Dost thou love me, cousin?" weeping, "I have loved thee long." DORM: 3.11, DORM-UIDO:2.43,
31 Love took up the glass of Time, and turn'd it in his glowing hands; DORM: 8.92, DORM-UIDO:2.76,
32 Every moment, lightly shaken, ran itself in golden sands. DORM: 2.74, DORM-UIDO:1.70,
33 Love took up the harp of Life, and smote on all the chords with might; DORM: 2.50, DORM-UIDO:1.03,
34 Smote the chord of Self, that, trembling, pass'd in music out of sight. DORM: 9.87, DORM-UIDO:4.01,
35 Many a morning on the moorland did we hear the copses ring, DORM: 3.88, DORM-UIDO:2.11,
36 And her whisper throng'd my pulses with the fulness of the Spring. DORM: 10.57, DORM-UIDO:4.34,
37 Many an evening by the waters did we watch the stately ships, DORM: 2.73, DORM-UIDO:1.87,
38 And our spirits rush'd together at the touching of the lips. DORM: 4.72, DORM-UIDO:3.21,
39 O my cousin, shallow-hearted! O my Amy, mine no more! DORM: 10.76, DORM-UIDO:3.82,
40 O the dreary, dreary moorland! O the barren, barren shore! DORM: 4.49, DORM-UIDO:2.45,
41 Falser than all fancy fathoms, falser than all songs have sung, DORM: 11.79, DORM-UIDO:3.31,
42 Puppet to a father's threat, and servile to a shrewish tongue! DORM: 4.31, DORM-UIDO:2.51,
43 Is it well to wish thee happy?—having known me—to decline DORM: 2.71, DORM-UIDO:2.14,
44 On a range of lower feelings and a narrower heart than mine! DORM: 2.84, DORM-UIDO:1.91,
45 Yet it shall be; thou shalt lower to his level day by day, DORM: 2.75, DORM-UIDO:1.98,
46 What is fine within thee growing coarse to sympathize with clay. DORM: 2.34, DORM-UIDO:1.48,
47 As the husband is, the wife is: thou art mated with a clown, DORM: 3.34, DORM-UIDO:2.16,
48 And the grossness of his nature will have weight to drag thee down. DORM: 3.10, DORM-UIDO:1.67,
49 He will hold thee, when his passion shall have spent its novel force, DORM: 1.89, DORM-UIDO:1.36,
50 Something better than his dog, a little dearer than his horse. DORM: 2.71, DORM-UIDO:1.18,
51 What is this? his eyes are heavy; think not they are glazed with wine. DORM: 2.00, DORM-UIDO:0.63,
52 Go to him, it is thy duty, kiss him, take his hand in thine. DORM: 2.51, DORM-UIDO:1.75,
53 It may be my lord is weary, that his brain is overwrought: DORM: 2.01, DORM-UIDO:0.13,
54 Soothe him with thy finer fancies, touch him with thy lighter thought. DORM: 3.45, DORM-UIDO:2.75,
55 He will answer to the purpose, easy things to understand— DORM: 2.27, DORM-UIDO:1.67,
56 Better thou wert dead before me, tho' I slew thee with my hand! DORM: 3.29, DORM-UIDO:2.38,
57 Better thou and I were lying, hidden from the heart's disgrace, DORM: 3.37, DORM-UIDO:2.47,
58 Roll'd in one another's arms, and silent in a last embrace. DORM: 7.62, DORM-UIDO:1.09,
59 Cursed be the social wants that sin against the strength of youth! DORM: 2.15, DORM-UIDO:1.31,
60 Cursed be the social lies that warp us from the living truth! DORM: 2.80, DORM-UIDO:2.00,
61 Cursed be the sickly forms that err from honest Nature's rule! DORM: 3.35, DORM-UIDO:2.20,
62 Cursed be the gold that gilds the straiten'd forehead of the fool! DORM: 10.22, DORM-UIDO:4.16,
63 Well—'t is well that I should bluster!—Hadst thou less unworthy proved— DORM: 4.50, DORM-UIDO:3.22,
64 Would to God—for I had loved thee more than ever wife was loved. DORM: 2.09, DORM-UIDO:1.53,
65 Am I mad, that I should cherish that which bears but bitter fruit? DORM: 2.58, DORM-UIDO:1.75,
66 I will pluck it from my bosom, tho' my heart be at the root. DORM: 3.35, DORM-UIDO:1.57,
67 Never, tho' my mortal summers to such length of years should come DORM: 2.58, DORM-UIDO:1.66,
68 As the many-winter'd crow that leads the clanging rookery home. DORM: 10.45, DORM-UIDO:4.45,
69 Where is comfort? in division of the records of the mind? DORM: 2.09, DORM-UIDO:1.06,
70 Can I part her from herself, and love her, as I knew her, kind? DORM: 1.29, DORM-UIDO:0.82,
71 I remember one that perish'd; sweetly did she speak and move; DORM: 10.87, DORM-UIDO:4.10,
72 Such a one do I remember, whom to look at was to love. DORM: 1.62, DORM-UIDO:1.18,
73 Can I think of her as dead, and love her for the love she bore? DORM: 1.75, DORM-UIDO:1.00,
74 No—she never loved me truly; love is love for evermore. DORM: 1.79, DORM-UIDO:0.54,
75 Comfort? comfort scorn'd of devils! this is truth the poet sings, DORM: 9.94, DORM-UIDO:3.73,
76 That a sorrow's crown of sorrow is remembering happier things. DORM: 3.13, DORM-UIDO:2.24,
77 Drug thy memories, lest thou learn it, lest thy heart be put to proof, DORM: 3.05, DORM-UIDO:2.03,
78 In the dead unhappy night, and when the rain is on the roof. DORM: 2.88, DORM-UIDO:1.86,
79 Like a dog, he hunts in dreams, and thou art staring at the wall, DORM: 2.43, DORM-UIDO:1.82,
80 Where the dying night-lamp flickers, and the shadows rise and fall. DORM: 12.04, DORM-UIDO:5.78,
81 Then a hand shall pass before thee, pointing to his drunken sleep, DORM: 2.82, DORM-UIDO:2.09,
82 To thy widow'd marriage-pillows, to the tears that thou wilt weep. DORM: 16.28, DORM-UIDO:8.25,
83 Thou shalt hear the "Never, never," whisper'd by the phantom years, DORM: 9.91, DORM-UIDO:3.78,
84 And a song from out the distance in the ringing of thine ears; DORM: 3.11, DORM-UIDO:1.68,
85 And an eye shall vex thee, looking ancient kindness on thy pain. DORM: 2.96, DORM-UIDO:1.97,
86 Turn thee, turn thee on thy pillow; get thee to thy rest again. DORM: 1.72, DORM-UIDO:0.60,
87 Nay, but Nature brings thee solace; for a tender voice will cry. DORM: 2.89, DORM-UIDO:1.89,
88 'T is a purer life than thine, a lip to drain thy trouble dry. DORM: 2.82, DORM-UIDO:1.97,
89 Baby lips will laugh me down; my latest rival brings thee rest. DORM: 2.18, DORM-UIDO:1.48,
90 Baby fingers, waxen touches, press me from the mother's breast. DORM: 4.77, DORM-UIDO:3.16,
91 O, the child too clothes the father with a dearness not his due. DORM: 2.93, DORM-UIDO:1.40,
92 Half is thine and half is his: it will be worthy of the two. DORM: 2.15, DORM-UIDO:0.92,
93 O, I see thee old and formal, fitted to thy petty part, DORM: 2.66, DORM-UIDO:1.78,
94 With a little hoard of maxims preaching down a daughter's heart. DORM: 3.82, DORM-UIDO:2.65,
95 "They were dangerous guides the feelings—she herself was not exempt— DORM: 2.46, DORM-UIDO:1.89,
96 Truly, she herself had suffer'd"—Perish in thy self-contempt! DORM: 11.74, DORM-UIDO:1.98,
97 Overlive it—lower yet—be happy! wherefore should I care? DORM: 8.92, DORM-UIDO:1.05,
98 I myself must mix with action, lest I wither by despair. DORM: 1.71, DORM-UIDO:0.82,
99 What is that which I should turn to, lighting upon days like these? DORM: 2.13, DORM-UIDO:1.46,
100 Every door is barr'd with gold, and opens but to golden keys. DORM: 9.04, DORM-UIDO:2.76,
101 Every gate is throng'd with suitors, all the markets overflow. DORM: 9.33, DORM-UIDO:2.79,
102 I have but an angry fancy; what is that which I should do? DORM: 2.42, DORM-UIDO:1.32,
103 I had been content to perish, falling on the foeman's ground, DORM: 9.99, DORM-UIDO:3.34,
104 When the ranks are roll'd in vapour, and the winds are laid with sound. DORM: 8.62, DORM-UIDO:2.75,
105 But the jingling of the guinea helps the hurt that Honour feels, DORM: 3.25, DORM-UIDO:2.24,
106 And the nations do but murmur, snarling at each other's heels. DORM: 4.15, DORM-UIDO:2.89,
107 Can I but relive in sadness? I will turn that earlier page. DORM: 2.23, DORM-UIDO:0.93,
108 Hide me from my deep emotion, O thou wondrous Mother-Age! DORM: 9.10, DORM-UIDO:2.64,
109 Make me feel the wild pulsation that I felt before the strife, DORM: 3.29, DORM-UIDO:1.96,
110 When I heard my days before me, and the tumult of my life; DORM: 2.31, DORM-UIDO:1.02,
111 Yearning for the large excitement that the coming years would yield, DORM: 2.93, DORM-UIDO:2.08,
112 Eager-hearted as a boy when first he leaves his father's field, DORM: 7.28, DORM-UIDO:0.37,
113 And at night along the dusky highway near and nearer drawn, DORM: 3.50, DORM-UIDO:2.45,
114 Sees in heaven the light of London flaring like a dreary dawn; DORM: 3.47, DORM-UIDO:2.32,
115 And his spirit leaps within him to be gone before him then, DORM: 3.03, DORM-UIDO:2.20,
116 Underneath the light he looks at, in among the throngs of men: DORM: 1.96, DORM-UIDO:0.72,
117 Men, my brothers, men the workers, ever reaping something new: DORM: 2.62, DORM-UIDO:1.35,
118 That which they have done but earnest of the things that they shall do: DORM: 2.03, DORM-UIDO:1.10,
119 For I dipt into the future, far as human eye could see, DORM: 3.28, DORM-UIDO:1.46,
120 Saw the Vision of the world, and all the wonder that would be; DORM: 1.50, DORM-UIDO:0.70,
121 Saw the heavens fill with commerce, argosies of magic sails, DORM: 10.06, DORM-UIDO:3.76,
122 Pilots of the purple twilight dropping down with costly bales; DORM: 4.10, DORM-UIDO:2.34,
123 Heard the heavens fill with shouting, and there rain'd a ghastly dew DORM: 8.89, DORM-UIDO:3.04,
124 From the nations' airy navies grappling in the central blue; DORM: 5.41, DORM-UIDO:4.18,
125 Far along the world-wide whisper of the south-wind rushing warm, DORM: 4.60, DORM-UIDO:3.00,
126 With the standards of the peoples plunging thro' the thunder-storm; DORM: 4.89, DORM-UIDO:3.86,
127 Till the war-drum throbb'd no longer, and the battle-flags were furl'd DORM: 16.39, DORM-UIDO:6.69,
128 In the Parliament of man, the Federation of the world. DORM: 1.90, DORM-UIDO:0.51,
129 There the common sense of most shall hold a fretful realm in awe, DORM: 3.49, DORM-UIDO:2.17,
130 And the kindly earth shall slumber, lapt in universal law. DORM: 4.73, DORM-UIDO:3.13,
131 So I triumph'd ere my passion sweeping thro' me left me dry, DORM: 9.78, DORM-UIDO:3.70,
132 Left me with the palsied heart, and left me with the jaundiced eye; DORM: 4.33, DORM-UIDO:2.17,
133 Eye, to which all order festers, all things here are out of joint: DORM: 3.20, DORM-UIDO:1.75,
134 Science moves, but slowly, slowly, creeping on from point to point: DORM: 2.82, DORM-UIDO:1.92,
135 Slowly comes a hungry people, as a lion, creeping nigher, DORM: 9.30, DORM-UIDO:2.82,
136 Glares at one that nods and winks behind a slowly-dying fire. DORM: 9.50, DORM-UIDO:3.36,
137 Yet I doubt not thro' the ages one increasing purpose runs, DORM: 1.88, DORM-UIDO:0.52,
138 And the thoughts of men are widen'd with the process of the suns. DORM: 9.73, DORM-UIDO:3.11,
139 What is that to him that reaps not harvest of his youthful joys, DORM: 3.91, DORM-UIDO:1.84,
140 Tho' the deep heart of existence beat for ever like a boy's? DORM: 1.83, DORM-UIDO:0.92,
141 Knowledge comes, but wisdom lingers, and I linger on the shore, DORM: 3.48, DORM-UIDO:2.47,
142 And the individual withers, and the world is more and more. DORM: 3.40, DORM-UIDO:1.80,
143 Knowledge comes, but wisdom lingers, and he bears a laden breast, DORM: 3.05, DORM-UIDO:1.93,
144 Full of sad experience, moving toward the stillness of his rest. DORM: 2.26, DORM-UIDO:0.88,
145 Hark, my merry comrades call me, sounding on the bugle-horn, DORM: 6.89, DORM-UIDO:0.51,
146 They to whom my foolish passion were a target for their scorn: DORM: 2.78, DORM-UIDO:1.65,
147 Shall it not be scorn to me to harp on such a moulder'd string? DORM: 9.55, DORM-UIDO:3.41,
148 I am shamed thro' all my nature to have loved so slight a thing. DORM: 3.62, DORM-UIDO:2.31,
149 Weakness to be wroth with weakness! woman's pleasure, woman's pain— DORM: 4.06, DORM-UIDO:2.58,
150 Nature made them blinder motions bounded in a shallower brain: DORM: 4.28, DORM-UIDO:3.13,
151 Woman is the lesser man, and all thy passions, match'd with mine, DORM: 10.57, DORM-UIDO:4.41,
152 Are as moonlight unto sunlight, and as water unto wine— DORM: 3.68, DORM-UIDO:2.82,
153 Here at least, where nature sickens, nothing. Ah, for some retreat DORM: 2.94, DORM-UIDO:1.82,
154 Deep in yonder shining Orient, where my life began to beat; DORM: 3.40, DORM-UIDO:2.53,
155 Where in wild Mahratta-battle fell my father evil-starr'd,— DORM: 13.33, DORM-UIDO:3.34,
156 I was left a trampled orphan, and a selfish uncle's ward. DORM: 4.45, DORM-UIDO:3.38,
157 Or to burst all links of habit—there to wander far away, DORM: 1.91, DORM-UIDO:1.14,
158 On from island unto island at the gateways of the day. DORM: 3.43, DORM-UIDO:2.21,
159 Larger constellations burning, mellow moons and happy skies, DORM: 3.29, DORM-UIDO:1.82,
160 Breadths of tropic shade and palms in cluster, knots of Paradise. DORM: 2.73, DORM-UIDO:0.51,
161 Never comes the trader, never floats an European flag, DORM: 2.02, DORM-UIDO:1.02,
162 Slides the bird o'er lustrous woodland, swings the trailer from the crag; DORM: 4.98, DORM-UIDO:3.12,
163 Droops the heavy-blossom'd bower, hangs the heavy-fruited tree— DORM: 10.68, DORM-UIDO:3.12,
164 Summer isles of Eden lying in dark-purple spheres of sea. DORM: 10.22, DORM-UIDO:3.94,
165 There methinks would be enjoyment more than in this march of mind, DORM: 2.81, DORM-UIDO:1.33,
166 In the steamship, in the railway, in the thoughts that shake mankind. DORM: 3.43, DORM-UIDO:1.69,
167 There the passions cramp'd no longer shall have scope and breathing space; DORM: 10.16, DORM-UIDO:4.12,
168 I will take some savage woman, she shall rear my dusky race. DORM: 2.63, DORM-UIDO:1.62,
169 Iron-jointed, supple-sinew'd, they shall dive, and they shall run, DORM: 17.01, DORM-UIDO:7.41,
170 Catch the wild goat by the hair, and hurl their lances in the sun; DORM: 3.32, DORM-UIDO:2.24,
171 Whistle back the parrot's call, and leap the rainbows of the brooks, DORM: 2.94, DORM-UIDO:1.82,
172 Not with blinded eyesight poring over miserable books— DORM: 4.01, DORM-UIDO:3.04,
173 Fool, again the dream, the fancy! but I know my words are wild, DORM: 1.71, DORM-UIDO:1.08,
174 But I count the gray barbarian lower than the Christian child. DORM: 3.29, DORM-UIDO:2.31,
175 I, to herd with narrow foreheads, vacant of our glorious gains, DORM: 4.08, DORM-UIDO:2.85,
176 Like a beast with lower pleasures, like a beast with lower pains! DORM: 2.63, DORM-UIDO:1.98,
177 Mated with a squalid savage—what to me were sun or clime? DORM: 3.76, DORM-UIDO:1.95,
178 I the heir of all the ages, in the foremost files of time— DORM: 3.04, DORM-UIDO:1.38,
179 I that rather held it better men should perish one by one, DORM: 2.32, DORM-UIDO:1.38,
180 Than that earth should stand at gaze like Joshua's moon in Ajalon! DORM: 9.56, DORM-UIDO:3.33,
181 Not in vain the distance beacons. Forward, forward let us range, DORM: 2.91, DORM-UIDO:1.90,
182 Let the great world spin for ever down the ringing grooves of change. DORM: 3.04, DORM-UIDO:2.08,
183 Thro' the shadow of the globe we sweep into the younger day; DORM: 2.57, DORM-UIDO:1.52,
184 Better fifty years of Europe than a cycle of Cathay. DORM: 2.12, DORM-UIDO:0.97,
185 Mother-Age (for mine I knew not) help me as when life begun: DORM: 6.89, DORM-UIDO:0.21,
186 Rift the hills, and roll the waters, flash the lightnings, weigh the Sun. DORM: 3.01, DORM-UIDO:1.21,
187 O, I see the crescent promise of my spirit hath not set. DORM: 2.97, DORM-UIDO:2.30,
188 Ancient founts of inspiration well thro' all my fancy yet. DORM: 3.26, DORM-UIDO:1.66,
189 Howsoever these things be, a long farewell to Locksley Hall! DORM: 3.86, DORM-UIDO:2.04,
190 Now for me the woods may wither, now for me the roof-tree fall. DORM: 9.67, DORM-UIDO:3.46,
191 Comes a vapour from the margin, blackening over heath and holt, DORM: 3.59, DORM-UIDO:2.49,
192 Cramming all the blast before it, in its breast a thunderbolt. DORM: 2.82, DORM-UIDO:1.32,
193 Let it fall on Locksley Hall, with rain or hail, or fire or snow; DORM: 2.50, DORM-UIDO:1.30,
194 For the mighty wind arises, roaring seaward, and I go. DORM: 4.99, DORM-UIDO: 4.05
